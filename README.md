# markviewer
A very simple Markdown viewer

It is a study for [ Writing Your First Electron App](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/first-app).
I just try to use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to write this app 
and use [Showdown](http://showdownjs.com/) to convert Markdown to html.
